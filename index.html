     <p>This is a tictactoe-playing robot that I made. All the moves are hard coded (so they don't always line up perfectly with the grid). That involved using 6 buttons to control the 3 motors forward/backward until the pen ended up in the desired location on the grid. Then I saved all those moves so that I could play them back whenever I needed to go back to that grid location. While this method avoided the complicated delta robot kinematics, it involved some error especially because the docked/starting position of the robot could not always be exactly the same.
     <p>Uses 3 stepper motors, raspberry pi, and webcam. Mechanism is inspired by delta robot and uses some 3d printed parts I designed, as well as other parts from robotics kits. Programmed using python and uses OpenCV for color detection of the opponent's (the human) moves and the game strategy uses minimax algorithm. 
        It is currently set up to where the robot always plays first (which is why its first move ends up being the first box in all the test rounds) but I can switch that up in the code.
    </p>   
    <p>While I first attempted to create an object detection model to identify X's and O's, it was difficult to obtain enough control on the robot pen to draw these shapes. Color detection proved to be a good alternative. </p>

            <p>I learned a lot about OOP by writing the code for this.</p>
