    <h1>Embedded Systems Projects</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm interested in robotics, machine learning, software, and 3D art. Here is some of my work!- including both independent and team projects.</p>

    <h2>Digital Piano  (2024)</h2>
    <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Freel%2F562385349862565%2F&show_text=false&width=267&t=0" width="267" height="476" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
     <p>The piano was built from scratch with laser cut wood and springs. We used Hall Effect sensors and ADCs to measure how far each key was pressed down and detected how many were pressed at a time. This information was used to modulate the addition and amplitude of notes accordingly, before sending them out to play through a DAC or using a bluetooth speaker depending on the selected mode.</p>
     <p>24 piano notes sampled at 11kHz were stored on an SD card, and was able to be switched out with another SD card to hear an organ instrument instead.</p>

    <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe-Playing Delta Robot (Against Human) (2023)</h2>

     <p>This is a tictactoe-playing robot that I made. All the moves are hard coded (so they don't always line up perfectly with the grid). That involved using 6 buttons to control the 3 motors forward/backward until the pen ended up in the desired location on the grid. Then I saved all those moves so that I could play them back whenever I needed to go back to that grid location. While this method avoided the complicated delta robot kinematics, it involved some error especially because the docked/starting position of the robot could not always be exactly the same.
     <p>Uses 3 stepper motors, raspberry pi, and webcam. Mechanism is inspired by delta robot and uses some 3d printed parts I designed, as well as other parts from robotics kits. Programmed using python and uses OpenCV for color detection of the opponent's moves. The game strategy itself uses minimax algorithm. 
</p>   
    <p>While I first attempted to create an object detection model to identify X's and O's, it was difficult to obtain enough control on the robot pen to draw these shapes. Color detection proved to be a good alternative. </p>

        <h2>Recreating Angry Birds Video Game On LCD With Microcontroller (2022)</h2>

                <p>Video shows testing of the game code while it was in progress, hence the glitches.</p>
                <p>The final game utilized a joystick to control the trajectory of the birds, a resistor DAC for sound effects, and supported multiple difficulty levels.</p>
